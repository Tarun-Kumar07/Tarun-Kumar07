# Welcome

I'm Tarun, a software engineer embarking on an exciting journey into quantum computing. Excited to explore and learn along the way!

## About Me

- Software Engineer at ION Group
- Undergraduate degree in Electronics and Telecommunications
- Sparked interest in quantum computing while simulating Shor's algorithm on FPGA during undergrad project. [View publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9807860)
- Explored quantum computing through completion of the IBM Space Explorer Program, earning an Advance badge. [View badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/28fb91b1-077d-45e3-8f1a-77a383ee392c/public_url)
- Ranked in the top 100 of iQHack coding challenges. [View certificate](https://cloud.pennylane.ai/profiles/ob/certificates/permalink/1cd1d437-e93c-4455-acd0-b9738e61cd67)
