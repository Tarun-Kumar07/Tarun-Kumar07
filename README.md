# Welcome

I'm Tarun, a software engineer embarking on an exciting journey into quantum computing. Excited to explore and learn along the way!

## About Me

- Software Engineer at ION Group
- Undergraduate degree in Electronics and Telecommunications
- Sparked interest in quantum computing while simulating Shor's algorithm on FPGA during undergrad project. [View publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9807860)
- Explored quantum computing through completion of the IBM Space Explorer Program, earning an Advance badge. [View badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/28fb91b1-077d-45e3-8f1a-77a383ee392c/public_url)
- Ranked in the top 100 of iQHack coding challenges. [View certificate](https://cloud.pennylane.ai/profiles/ob/certificates/permalink/1cd1d437-e93c-4455-acd0-b9738e61cd67)

## Projects I've contributed to

- Enhanced the testing framework by implementing `assert_equal` in
  [PR #5780](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5780). This feature
  not only compares two operators but also provides detailed explanations
  for any differences, improving deb
- Implemented `QutritChannel` functionality in  [PR #5973](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5793) operation, addressing [Issue #5649](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/issues/5649).
  This work enabled noise model support for qutrits in quantum computing simulations, extending the framework's capabilities beyond qubits,
  with added methods and tests to ensure robustness and accuracy.
- **Enhanced Shot Sampling Efficiency:** Improved PennyLane's shot sampling
  process by implementing the `shots.bins()` method in
  [PR #5433](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/5433). This update
  enables efficient sampling by processing shot quantities in partitions,
  reducing redundancy and improving overall performance.

- Resolved [Issue #603](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python/issues/603) by addressing conflicts 
where `FreeParameter` names clashed with OpenQASM reserved keywords in [PR #999](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python/pull/999).
